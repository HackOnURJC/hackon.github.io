# Contributing

As you may know, you can't submit changes directly to the `public` branch, which is the one used for deploying the website.

In order to contribute to this project and modify information on the website, you must add your changes to a new branch or to the `main` branch, used for development, and then open a [Pull Request](https://github.com/HackOnURJC/hackon.github.io/pulls) with the proposed changes. At least one revision is needed for your changes to be approved and pushed to the `public` branch.
